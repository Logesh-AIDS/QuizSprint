Project: Multiplayer Learning Quiz – Full Replit Development Guide
1. Core Concept (Elaborated)
User Flow:
Users open the app → land on Home page.
They can create a new room (auto-generated code) or join an existing room using a code.
All players in a room wait in a Lobby with live updates of who joined.
The quiz starts → players answer multiple-choice questions in real-time.
Scores and rankings update instantly on a dynamic leaderboard.
After the quiz ends → Results page shows final rankings, confetti animation, and options to replay or share.
Core Interactivity:
WebSockets for real-time question broadcasting and live score updates.
Optional chat or emoji reactions to make it social and fun.
2. Core Features (MVP) – Expanded
Feature	Detailed Description	Tech Approach / Prompt for Replit
Real-time quiz rooms	Users create/join rooms. Each room has unique code, tracks players.	Use Socket.io for real-time room management. Replit prompt: “Create a Node.js server with Socket.io that allows multiple users to join a room using a room code. Broadcast room updates to all connected clients.”
Dynamic leaderboard	Live score updates after each question. Visualize top players.	Use Chart.js or D3.js. Replit prompt: “On the client, create a real-time updating leaderboard chart using Chart.js that receives scores via WebSocket.”
Timer per question	Countdown per question with visual bar.	Client-side JS. Replit prompt: “Add a timer progress bar for each quiz question, auto-submitting when time runs out.”
Score calculation	Points for correct answer + speed + streak bonus.	Server-side logic. Replit prompt: “Write a Node.js function to calculate quiz scores based on correct answers, time taken, and streak bonuses.”
Responsive UI	Mobile-first, grid layout for question + leaderboard.	Tailwind CSS. Replit prompt: “Design a responsive quiz UI with Tailwind CSS: question panel on top, answer buttons below, leaderboard on side for desktop, stacked for mobile.”
Optional chat	Real-time chat/emoji reactions.	WebSockets. Replit prompt: “Implement a live chat sidebar with WebSockets, showing messages or emoji reactions instantly to all users in the room.”

4. Data Flow – Detailed
Server (Node.js + Socket.io)
Handles room creation, joining, and tracking players
Sends questions to all clients in a room simultaneously
Receives answers, calculates scores, and broadcasts updated leaderboard
Optional: store mock data or connect to JSON database for persistence
Client (React + Tailwind CSS)
Receives room updates, questions, and leaderboard data
Renders interactive charts and animations
Sends answers and ready status to server
Data Example (JSON)
{
  "rooms": {
    "ABC123": {
      "players": [
        {"name": "Alice", "score": 10},
        {"name": "Bob", "score": 5}
      ],
      "currentQuestion": 2
    }
  }
}
